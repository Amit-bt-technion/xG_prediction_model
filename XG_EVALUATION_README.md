# xG Model Evaluation

This document describes the comprehensive evaluation functionality for xG (expected goals) prediction models.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Test Set Isolation

**This evaluation script ensures ZERO data leakage by:**
- Using the exact same train/test split as the training process
- Only evaluating samples from the test set (never seen during training)
- Validating that all samples come from test matches only
- Requiring matching `train_ratio`, `val_ratio`, and `seed` parameters

**You MUST use the same split parameters as training to ensure valid evaluation!**

## Overview

The xG evaluation script (`xg_evaluation.py`) provides detailed analysis of trained xG models by:

1. **Sampling balanced shots**: 10 goals and 10 non-goals (or custom amounts)
2. **Model predictions**: Raw 0-1 probability values from your trained model
3. **StatsBomb comparison**: Original StatsBomb xG values for reference
4. **Comprehensive shot data**: Detailed information about each shot scenario

## Features

### 📊 Balanced Sampling from Test Set Only
- **CRITICAL**: Only samples from test set matches to ensure no data leakage
- Applies same train/test split as training (80% train, 10% val, 10% test by default)
- Automatically finds and samples equal numbers of goal and non-goal shots
- Ensures sufficient sequence history (200 events before each shot)
- Randomized selection for unbiased evaluation within test set

### 🎯 Prediction Comparison
- **Model xG**: Raw continuous output from your trained regression model
- **StatsBomb xG**: Original StatsBomb expected goals value
- **Difference**: Absolute difference between model and StatsBomb predictions

### ⚽ Comprehensive Shot Details
For each shot, displays:

**Location & Timing:**
- Shot location coordinates (x, y)
- End location (x, y, z) including height
- Match period and minute
- Shot duration

**Shot Characteristics:**
- First time shot
- Aerial won
- Open goal opportunity
- Deflected shot
- Follows dribble

**Context:**
- Under pressure
- Counterpress situation
- Team ID and possession
- Player position

### 📈 Summary Statistics

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Load Data**: Uses same preprocessing as training with masking for xG prediction
2. **Sample Shots**: Finds shots with sufficient sequence history
3. **Model Inference**: Runs sequences through trained model for predictions
4. **Data Extraction**: Extracts original StatsBomb data from unmasked events
5. **Display**: Formats and presents comprehensive shot information

### Masking
The evaluation automatically applies the same field masking used during training:
- `out` (index 6)
- `shot.end_location[0,1,2]` (indices 72, 73, 74)
- `shot.aerial_won` (index 75)
- `shot.open_goal` (index 78) 
- `shot.statsbomb_xg` (index 79)
- `shot.deflected` (index 80)
- `shot.outcome.id` (index 83)

This ensures the model doesn't have access to the target information during prediction.

### Data Decoding
The script includes comprehensive decoding of normalized event vectors back to human-readable values:
- Location coordinates denormalized to pitch dimensions (120x80)
- Temporal features converted to actual minutes/seconds
- Categorical features mapped to meaningful labels
- Height information converted to meters

## Model Architecture Assumptions

The evaluation assumes:
- **Model Type**: `ContinuousValueTransformer` (regression model)
- **Input**: Embedded sequences of length 200
- **Output**: Single continuous value (xG prediction)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 32 (matching encoder output)

If your model has different architecture, update the model creation in `evaluate_xg_model_detailed()`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No shots found"**: Ensure your data contains shot events and has sufficient sequence history
2. **Model loading errors**: Check that model path is correct and architecture matches
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce `num_samples` or `sequence_length` for large datasets
4. **Cache conflicts**: Clear cache directory if switching between different tasks

### Performance Tips

- Use cached embeddings to speed up repeated evaluations
- Reduce `num_samples` for quick testing
- Ensure sufficient disk space for cache files
- Use GPU if available for faster inference

## Integration

The evaluation script integrates seamlessly with the existing xG training pipeline:
- Uses same preprocessing and masking logic
- Compatible with trained model checkpoints
- Leverages existing dataset and embedding infrastructure
- Maintains consistency with training data flow

This ensures that evaluation results accurately reflect model performance on the same type of data used during training.
